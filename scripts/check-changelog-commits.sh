# Verify that the commit references in CHANGELOG.md are real.
#
# A changelog entry is only useful if its link takes you to the change. Ours are
# reference-style:
#
#     - Some change ([abc1234])
#     [abc1234]: https://github.com/LeakIX/l9format/commit/abc1234
#
# and the hash is written by hand, so it rots in three ways. This checks all
# three:
#
#   1. The referenced commit exists in this repository. A hash typed from memory,
#      or one left behind after a commit was amended or rebased (which changes the
#      hash), points at nothing.
#   2. Every reference has a link definition, so it renders as a link rather than
#      as literal "[abc1234]" text.
#   3. The link URL points at the hash it is keyed by. Copy-pasting a previous
#      link and editing only the key gives you an entry that silently sends the
#      reader to the wrong commit.
